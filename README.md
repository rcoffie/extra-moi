# Linux Server Deployment & Hardening Guide  

ðŸš€ **Welcome to my Linux Server Setup Documentation!**  

This repository serves as my personal checklist and reference for deploying and securing new Linux servers. Whether it's a cloud instance, VPS, or physical machine, I follow these practices to ensure a secure and stable baseline configuration.  

### What's Here?  

- **Initial Setup Steps**: User creation, SSH hardening, package updates  
- **Security Hardening**: Firewall rules, intrusion prevention, service hardening  
- **Essential Services**: Common configurations for web servers, databases, etc.  
- **Automation**: Scripts and tools to streamline deployment  

### Why This Exists  

I created this repo to:  
âœ” Document my standard procedures for consistency  
âœ” Share knowledge with others  
âœ” Serve as a quick reference for future deployments  

### How to Use  

1. Browse the [docs](docs/) for detailed guides  
2. Check out the [scripts](scripts/) for automation examples  
3. Customize for your own needs (security requirements vary!)  

**Note**: These are my personal practicesâ€”always adapt to your environmentâ€™s specific needs.
